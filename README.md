# LogParser
Parser for Elephant WoW AddOn's log files.

#### Instructions:
1. Pass location of logs file as an argument.
2. Wait with patience.
3. Segregatted output files should be in *output* folder.
If files are empty or if logs have been only partially parsed that means there was an unhandled exception. No error messages because I haven't implemented them yet.

It kinda works, but some messages could end up in NotDefined.txt.
